        Due to the rise of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, the RAM market has been significantly shifted.
        Most of the AI companies have been buying a lot of <strong>RAM</strong> to upgrade their AI apps or websites.
        Therefore, RAM prices have <strong>skyrocketed</strong> in the last few years.
        Some other companies also started their own AI, which again raised the prices of RAM, an example is <strong>Nvidia</strong>.

        As a student who solely depends on my allowance given by my parents, this hurts my pockets a lot.
        Without a stable income, it is hard to buy RAM nowadays.
        From <strong>6,000 pesos</strong> for RAM sticks to now a whopping <strong>9-10,000 pesos</strong>.
        That's just an estimation from what I saw in the online PC shops like <strong>PC Express</strong>.
        It's a lot harder now to buy RAM because a lot of people are also <strong>scalping</strong> them and selling them for a higher price than the SRP.

      <p>
        In conclusion, it's good that we have AI now, but there are also a lot of downsides for normal people.
        Like RAM prices skyrocketing and limited RAM productions.
        So I’m saying for people like me who don't have a stable income, it's hard to upgrade my setup without begging my parents for money.
