          I’m a second-year Computer Science student and I’m starting to think seriously about what I want to do in the future. I want to become a data analyst because I like working with data and solving problems in a logical way. My older brother is a data analyst, and seeing the kind of work he does inspired me to follow the same path. I feel that this career fits my interest in technology.

          I want to be a data analyst because I enjoy analyzing information and spotting patterns. It’s a field that needs both technical and critical thinking, which I want to keep improving. Watching my brother work with real data and turn it into useful insights motivated me even more. Data analysts help companies make smarter decisions, and I want to be part of that.
        </p>

          Right now, I’m building my foundation in programming, databases, and problem-solving. I’m learning tools and concepts that are important for data-related work. Some topics are challenging, but I’m doing my best to improve. I plan to study SQL, Excel, and Python to strengthen my data analysis skills. I am also starting to look for possible OJT or internship places where I can gain real experience.

          I also want to travel to different islands in the Philippines someday. There are many places here that I haven’t visited yet. I hope to work as a data analyst while having the flexibility to travel. I think having both a career I enjoy and the chance to explore new places will make my future fulfilling.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to become a data analyst and succeed in the IT field. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m willing to work for it. I’ll keep studying and practicing to reach this career. I’m excited to see where this path will take me.
