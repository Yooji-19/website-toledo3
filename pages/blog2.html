        <h2>The Weight of Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up as the child of a teacher felt like living with expectations that were always one step ahead of me. My mother’s profession shaped not only her life, but mine as well, especially because I studied in the same school where she worked. There was a constant pressure to be “better,” not just for myself, but for her reputation as a teacher. Mistakes felt bigger, and failures felt heavier, because I knew they would not stay private. I learned early on that being a teacher’s child meant carrying invisible weight.

        <h2>Living Under the Watchful Eye</h2>
        <p>
          From grade school to junior high school, my mother would ask my teachers ahead of time if I was doing well, which made me feel watched even when I tried my best. When I didn’t perform well, she would get mad, and her disappointment hurt more than any low grade ever could. I was not a tough kid—I cried easily—but I learned to hold my tears because crying only led to scolding. Over time, I became quiet with my emotions, keeping my struggles to myself to avoid making things worse. Even now, though she can no longer ask my professors, the pressure she created still lingers in me.

        <h2>Finding Peace in My Own Path</h2>
        <p>
          Today, I am doing better, surrounded by friends, and more confident in who I am becoming. However, the pressure has not completely disappeared, especially with an older brother who has already graduated and works, and a younger brother who is a scholar. Sometimes I feel stuck between their achievements, wondering where I fit in. Still, I am slowly learning that my journey does not have to look like theirs to be valid. In understanding this, I am finally giving myself the grace I wished I had as a child.
